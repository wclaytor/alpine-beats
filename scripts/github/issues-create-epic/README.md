# GitHub Epic & Issues Creator

## Overview

The `create-epic.py` script creates GitHub issues from structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter. It automatically handles label creation, issue linking, and epic management using the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## Features

✨ **Smart Label Management**: Automatically creates labels if they don't exist  
🏷️ **Smart Milestone Management**: Automatically creates milestones if they don't exist  
🔗 **Epic & Issue Linking**: Creates epics with linked child issues  
📊 **Dependency Tracking**: References dependencies between issues  
🎯 **Priority & Sprint Management**: Tracks priority, story points, and sprint assignments  
🔍 **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before creating actual issues  
📝 **Verbose Logging**: Optional detailed output for debugging  
🏠 **Current Repo Support**: Works with current repository or specify any repo  

## Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub CLI (gh)

The script requires GitHub CLI to be installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Check if gh is installed
gh --version

# If not installed, see: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

**Note**: GitHub Codespaces come with `gh` pre-installed and authenticated.

### 2. Python 3

Python 3.6 or higher is required:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 3. Python Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Preview (Dry Run)

Test your markdown file without creating issues:

```bash
# Using current repository
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md --dry-run

# Or specify a repository
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md --repo owner/repo --dry-run
```

### 2. Create Issues

Once satisfied with the preview, create the actual issues:

```bash
# Using current repository
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md

# Or specify a repository
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md --repo owner/repo
```

### 3. Verbose Mode

For detailed debugging information:

```bash
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md --verbose
```

## Command Line Options

```

## Features Demonstrated

### Test File (`test-epic.md`)

The included test file demonstrates:

1. ✅ **Epic Creation**: Creates a parent epic issue
2. ✅ **Child Issue Creation**: Creates 2 linked child issues
3. ✅ **Automatic Label Creation**: Creates labels that don't exist
4. ✅ **Automatic Milestone Creation**: Creates milestones that don't exist

6. ✅ **Metadata Management**: Priority, points, sprint information
7. ✅ **Bi-directional Linking**: Epic links to children, children link to epic
8. ✅ **Issue Checklist**: Epic contains checklist of all child issues

## Verifying Created Issues

Use the GitHub CLI to inspect created issues:

```bash
# List recent issues
gh issue list --limit 10

# View the epic issue
gh issue view 47

# View in browser
gh issue view 47 --web

# View a child issue
gh issue view 48

# List issues with specific label
gh issue list --label test

# Search for issues
gh issue list --search "TEST-001"
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "gh CLI is not authenticated"

**Solution**: 
```bash
gh auth login
```

### ❌ "gh CLI is not installed"

**Solution**: Install from https://cli.github.com/
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Windows
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Linux
# See https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
```

### ❌ "No module named 'yaml'"

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

### ❌ "File not found"

**Solution**: Verify the path to your markdown file is correct
```bash
# Use absolute or relative path
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py ./test-epic.md
```

### ❌ Rate Limiting Errors

**Solution**: The script includes delays between issue creation. If you still hit rate limits, wait a few minutes and try again.

### 🐛 Script Errors

**Solution**: Use verbose mode to see detailed output
```bash
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py test-epic.md --verbose
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Different Repositories

```bash
# Create issues in a different repository
python3 create-epic.py epic.md --repo owner/different-repo

# Preview for different repository
python3 create-epic.py epic.md --repo owner/different-repo --dry-run
```

### Creating Your Own Epic Files

1. Copy `test-epic.md` as a template
2. Update the epic frontmatter with your epic details
3. Update ticket frontmatters with your ticket details
4. Update ticket content with your implementation details
5. Run in dry-run mode to validate
6. Create the actual issues

### Best Practices

1. **Always dry-run first**: Validate your input file before creating issues
2. **Use descriptive ticket IDs**: Make them easy to reference (e.g., `AUTH-001`, `UI-002`)
3. **Organize by sprint**: Group tickets by sprint in your markdown file
4. **Include acceptance criteria**: Clear criteria make tickets actionable
5. **Set dependencies carefully**: Only add dependencies that truly block work
6. **Use consistent labels**: Establish label conventions for your team
7. **Version control your epic files**: Track changes to your planning documents

## Script Compatibility

- ✅ **Works with GitHub Codespaces**: Pre-installed `gh` CLI
- ✅ **Works with older gh versions**: Compatible with gh CLI versions that don't support `--json` on `issue create`
- ✅ **Works locally**: Install `gh` CLI and authenticate
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Improvements in Current Version

✨ **Recent enhancements**:

1. **Automatic Label Creation**: No need to manually create labels first
2. **Automatic Milestone Creation**: No need to manually create milestones first
3. **Optional --repo Parameter**: Defaults to current repository
4. **Improved Logging**: Clean, informative output with progress indicators
5. **Better Error Messages**: Shows relevant errors without verbose help text
6. **Verbose Mode**: Optional detailed debugging output
7. **Compatibility**: Works with gh CLI versions in GitHub Codespaces
8. **Smart Caching**: Caches existing labels and milestones to avoid duplicate API calls

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create your epic markdown file
cp test-epic.md my-feature-epic.md
nano my-feature-epic.md  # Edit with your details

# 2. Validate with dry run
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py my-feature-epic.md --dry-run

# 3. Create the issues
python3 scripts/github/issues-create-epic/create-epic.py my-feature-epic.md

# 4. View the epic
gh issue view <epic-number> --web

# 5. Track progress
gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1"
```
