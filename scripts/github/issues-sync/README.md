# GitHub Issues Sync

A Python script to synchronize GitHub issues with local markdown documentation in your repository.

## Overview

This script maintains a local mirror of your GitHub issues in `.github/issues/` directory, allowing you to:
- Keep issue documentation alongside your code
- Add implementation notes and decisions to issues
- Track the complete history of issue resolution
- Create new issues from markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Batch create epics with child issues

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- PyYAML library

## Installation

1. Ensure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated:
```bash
gh auth status
```

2. Install required Python package:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## Usage

### Pull All Issues from GitHub

Sync all issues (open and closed) from your GitHub repository to local folders:

```bash
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py pull
```

This creates the following structure:
```
.github/issues/
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-0001/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ issue-0001.md
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-0002/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ issue-0002.md
â””â”€â”€ issue-0003/
    â””â”€â”€ issue-0003.md
```

Each markdown file contains:
- YAML frontmatter with issue metadata (number, title, state, labels, assignees, etc.)
- Original issue description
- A section for your implementation notes

### Create a Single Issue

Create a new GitHub issue from a markdown file:

```bash
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py create path/to/issue.md
```

The markdown file should use this format:

```markdown
---
title: Add user authentication system
labels: 
  - enhancement
  - backend
assignees: 
  - "@me"
milestone: "v1.0"
---

## Overview

Your issue description here...

## Requirements

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
```

### Create an Epic with Child Issues

Create an epic issue along with multiple child issues from a single file:

```bash
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py epic path/to/epic.md
```

The epic file format uses `---` separators between issues:

```markdown
---
title: "Epic: Implement Feature X"
labels:
  - epic
  - high-priority
---

Epic description here...

---

---
title: "Task: Setup backend"
labels:
  - backend
  - task
---

First child issue description...

---

---
title: "Task: Create frontend"
labels:
  - frontend
  - task
---

Second child issue description...
```

## File Structure

```
scripts/github/issues-sync/
â”œâ”€â”€ issues-sync.py          # Main sync script
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md               # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ single-issue.md     # Example single issue template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ epic-with-tasks.md  # Example epic with children
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bug-report.md       # Example bug report template
â””â”€â”€ test/
    â””â”€â”€ test-sync.sh        # Test script for validation
```

## Features

### Current Features

- âœ… Pull all issues from GitHub to local folders
- âœ… Create issues from markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- âœ… Create epics with multiple child issues
- âœ… Preserve issue metadata (labels, assignees, milestones)
- âœ… Support both open and closed issues
- âœ… Automatically create issue folders with standardized naming

### Planned Features

- ðŸ”„ Two-way sync (update GitHub from local changes)
- ðŸ’¬ Sync issue comments
- ðŸ“Ž Download and store issue attachments
- ðŸ”— Auto-link related issues
- ðŸ“‹ Issue templates support

## YAML Frontmatter Options

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | string | Issue title (required) | `"Fix login bug"` |
| `labels` | list | Issue labels | `["bug", "high-priority"]` |
| `assignees` | list | GitHub usernames | `["@me", "teammate"]` |
| `milestone` | string | Milestone name | `"v1.0"` |

## Issue Folder Structure

After pulling issues, each issue gets its own folder:

```
.github/issues/issue-0042/
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-0042.md           # Main issue file with metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation.md       # Your implementation notes (manual)
â”œâ”€â”€ research.md            # Research findings (manual)
â””â”€â”€ artifacts/             # Related files (manual)
    â”œâ”€â”€ diagram.png
    â””â”€â”€ test-results.json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Syncing**: Run `pull` regularly to keep local issues up-to-date
2. **Documentation**: Add implementation notes directly in issue folders
3. **Commit History**: Commit issue folders to track decision history
4. **Issue Templates**: Create reusable templates for common issue types
5. **Bulk Operations**: Use epic files for related issues that should be created together

## Examples

### Example 1: Pull and Document

```bash
# Pull latest issues
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py pull

# Add your notes to an issue
echo "## Solution\nImplemented using strategy pattern" >> .github/issues/issue-0042/implementation.md

# Commit your documentation
git add .github/issues/issue-0042/
git commit -m "docs: add implementation notes for issue #42"
```

### Example 2: Create Feature Request

Create `feature.md`:
```markdown
---
title: Add dark mode support
labels:
  - enhancement
  - ui
assignees:
  - "@me"
milestone: "v2.0"
---

Users have requested a dark mode option for better viewing at night.
```

Then run:
```bash
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py create feature.md
```

### Example 3: Create Sprint Backlog

Create `sprint-23.md`:
```markdown
---
title: "Sprint 23 Planning"
labels:
  - epic
  - planning
---

Sprint 23 goals and tasks

---

---
title: "Fix navigation bug"
labels:
  - bug
  - sprint-23
---

Navigation menu doesn't close on mobile

---

---
title: "Update user documentation"
labels:
  - documentation
  - sprint-23
---

Update docs for new features
```

Then run:
```bash
python scripts/github/issues-sync/issues-sync.py epic sprint-23.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `gh: command not found`
**Solution**: Install GitHub CLI from https://cli.github.com

### Issue: `No module named 'yaml'`
**Solution**: Install PyYAML: `pip install pyyaml`

### Issue: `gh auth status` shows not authenticated
**Solution**: Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts

### Issue: Script creates issues in wrong repository
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct repository directory, or use `gh repo set-default`
