# Documentation Update - Seven-Role Team Structure

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Author**: AI Assistant (Claude)
**Branch**: `25-organize-docs`
**Pull Request**: #26 - Organized docs and added scripts

## 🎯 Objective

Update all major documentation files to include the newly added Director and Domain-Expert roles, ensuring consistency across all AI assistant guidance documents.

## 📋 Changes Made

### Files Updated

1. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - GitHub Copilot instructions
2. **`docs/guides/Roles-Copilot.md`** - User-facing Copilot roles guide
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Claude-specific comprehensive instructions
4. **`AGENTS.md`** - AI agents role-based development guide

### Specific Updates

#### 1. Role Count and Structure
- Updated from **5 roles** to **7 roles** in all role methodology sections
- Added comprehensive documentation for both new roles with full context

#### 2. Director Role (🎬) Added
**Focus**: Project orchestration, team coordination, delivery facilitation

**Responsibilities**:
- Orchestrate collaboration between all roles
- Facilitate sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives
- Remove blockers and manage project risks
- Ensure successful delivery through effective coordination

**Alpine Beats Context**:
- Coordinates collaboration between all roles for feature development
- Facilitates sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives
- Tracks project progress and removes blockers to team productivity
- Manages risks and ensures successful delivery of Alpine Beats features

**Detection Keywords**: "coordinate", "sprint", "planning", "blockers", "risks", "facilitate", "team"

#### 3. Domain-Expert Role (🎓) Added
**Focus**: Music production domain knowledge, audio terminology, industry standards

**Responsibilities**:
- Validate music terminology and drum machine conventions
- Ensure audio synthesis accuracy matches real-world characteristics
- Define business rules and domain-specific validation
- Provide guidance on industry best practices

**Alpine Beats Context**:
- Ensures drum sounds match real-world drum characteristics and naming conventions
- Validates that sequencer patterns follow music production standards (time signatures, tempos)
- Provides guidance on audio synthesis parameters for authentic drum sounds
- Ensures terminology (BPM, beats, measures, swing) is used correctly throughout the application

**Detection Keywords**: "terminology", "industry standards", "business rules", "compliance", "domain", "authentic"

#### 4. Multi-Role Response Patterns Updated
All files now include Director and Domain-Expert in collaboration patterns:

```markdown
**🎬 Director Coordination**: [coordination aspects]
**🎯 Product-Owner Analysis**: [user value aspects]
**🎓 Domain-Expert Validation**: [domain accuracy aspects]
**🏗️ Architect Blueprint**: [technical aspects]
**🎨 Designer Specifications**: [UI/UX aspects]
**💻 Developer Implementation**: [code implementation]
**🧪 QA-Engineer Validation**: [testing aspects]
```

#### 5. Development Patterns Enhanced
All four common development patterns updated to 7-step workflows:

- **Adding New Drum Sound Pattern**: Now includes Director coordination and Domain-Expert validation
- **Sequencer Enhancement Pattern**: Now includes Director facilitation and Domain-Expert standards validation
- **Audio Effect Pattern**: Now includes Director coordination and Domain-Expert parameter validation
- **Mobile Optimization Pattern**: Now includes Director tracking and Domain-Expert workflow validation

#### 6. Role Detection Keywords Expanded
Added comprehensive keywords for both new roles to help AI assistants identify when to adopt each role perspective.

#### 7. Example Scenarios Updated
In Roles-Copilot.md, added Example 4 specifically showcasing Domain-Expert as primary role, and updated all existing examples to include Director and Domain-Expert contributions.

## 🎯 Current Seven-Role Structure

1. 🎬 **Director** - Project orchestration and coordination
2. 🎯 **Product-Owner** - User experience and feature prioritization
3. 🎓 **Domain-Expert** - Music production knowledge and terminology
4. 🏗️ **Architect** - Audio architecture and technical design
5. 🎨 **Designer** - Interface design and visual feedback
6. 💻 **Developer** - Implementation and coding
7. 🧪 **QA-Engineer** - Quality assurance and testing

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] All four major documentation files updated consistently
- [x] Director role fully documented with responsibilities and context
- [x] Domain-Expert role fully documented with responsibilities and context
- [x] Multi-role response patterns include both new roles
- [x] Role detection keywords expanded for both new roles
- [x] All development patterns updated to 7-step workflows
- [x] Examples and scenarios reflect complete team collaboration
- [x] Consistent formatting and structure across all files

## 🔄 Impact
