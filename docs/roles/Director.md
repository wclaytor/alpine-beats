@team Before planning, everyone review the sprint-planning skill for our agenda 
and capacity calculation methods. Product-Owner, use user-story-generator 
skill for any new stories we'll discuss.
```

**Architecture Reviews**:
```markdown
@architect Please document this decision using the technical-decision-record 
skill so we have a clear record of the rationale and trade-offs.
```

**Retrospectives**:
```markdown
@team Great work this sprint! I noticed we repeated the API documentation 
process several times. Should we capture this as a custom skill?
```
