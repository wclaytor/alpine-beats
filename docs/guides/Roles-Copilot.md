## üîÑ Multi-Role Collaboration Patterns

### **Automatic Role Selection**
````markdown
User: "I need a recipe search feature"

Copilot analyzes request and responds as multiple roles:

**üé¨ Director perspective:** 
- Coordinates feature planning and sprint integration
- Identifies cross-role dependencies and potential blockers

**üéØ Product-Owner perspective:** 
- User story format with acceptance criteria
- Success metrics definition

**üéì Domain-Expert perspective:**
- Validates terminology and business rules
- Ensures industry standards compliance

**üèóÔ∏è Architect perspective:**
- Technical approach with Alpine.js reactive patterns
- Performance requirements

**üíª Developer implementation:**
```javascript
// Complete Alpine.js search implementation
function recipeSearch() {
    return {
        searchTerm: '',
        get filteredRecipes() {
            // Optimized filtering logic
        }
    }
}
```
````

### **Role Handoff Pattern**
```
User: "Create a standalone recipe app"

1. Director: Coordinates project planning and team alignment
2. Product-Owner: Defines requirements and user stories
3. Domain-Expert: Validates domain concepts and terminology
4. Architect: Creates technical blueprint 
5. Designer: Specifies UI/UX system
6. Developer: Implements complete Alpine.js code
7. QA-Engineer: Provides testing checklist
```

## üéØ Practical Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Complex Feature Request**
```
User: "I need offline recipe filtering with mobile optimization"

Copilot Role Response:
üé¨ Director: Coordinates sprint planning, identifies dependencies, manages delivery
üéØ Product-Owner: User stories, acceptance criteria, success metrics
üéì Domain-Expert: Validates recipe terminology, dietary restrictions, cooking domain rules
üèóÔ∏è Architect: Alpine.js + localStorage architecture, performance targets
üé® Designer: Mobile-first UI specs, touch targets, accessibility
üíª Developer: Complete implementation with reactive patterns
üß™ QA-Engineer: Testing strategy, offline validation, mobile testing
```

### **Example 2: Technical Problem Solving**
```
User: "My Alpine.js modal isn't scrolling properly"

Primary Role: Developer (code issue)
Supporting Roles:
- Director: Coordinates problem resolution across roles
- Designer: Modal UX best practices
- QA-Engineer: Cross-browser testing approach
- Architect: Performance implications
```

### **Example 3: Requirements Clarification**
```
User: "What should this camping cookbook include?"

Primary Role: Product-Owner
Supporting Roles:
- Director: Facilitates requirements gathering and prioritization
- Domain-Expert: Validates cooking terminology and recipe standards
- Designer: User experience considerations
