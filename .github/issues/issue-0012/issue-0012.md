# Issue #12: Make each instrument label a button that previews the assigned sound

## Description

As a user
I want to tap a button to preview the sound for an instrument
So that I can hear what it sounds like and "play" it along with the current pattern

We already have the labels for each instrument in the kit
We can just make these buttons with the instrument name centered
When the user taps the button they can preview the assigned sound
