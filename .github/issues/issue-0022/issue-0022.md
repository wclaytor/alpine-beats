# Issue #22: Create epics with child issues

## Description

As a user 
I want to define a new epic with child issues in Markdown format
And run a script that uses the gh tool to create the issues in GitHub 
So that I don't have to do it manually 

We have the create-epic.py script and need to test it 
Please create a test input file with one epic and two child issues 
Then use the script with the test file
Then use the gh tool to see if the issues were created 

Note: Do not use the gh tool to create the issues. We need to use the script and then verify the result.
