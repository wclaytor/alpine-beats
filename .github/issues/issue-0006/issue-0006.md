# Issue #6: Create copilot-instructions.md based on the example

## Description

We already have a working prototype which is awesome 

We want to make sure Copilot understands the project and continues to use the Alpine.js best practices to maintain project quality 

We have defined the roles for the project and want Copilot agents to understand how and when to adopt the roles when working on project assignments 

We have an example '.github/copilot-instructions-example.md' file that describes a basic Alpine.js template project. Those ideas do not apply because we already have a working prototype. However, the basic concepts are valid, and the description of the roles is especially relevant. 

Please create a copilot-instructions.md for our project based on our actual app and how the roles apply to our specific domain.
