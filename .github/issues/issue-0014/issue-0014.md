# Issue #14: Update README.md

## Description

As a user
I want an up to date README.md
So that I know the current state of the project

We have made some changes since this file was created:
- Eliminated the extra files and made this a true single-page PWA (index.html)
- Replaced the instrument labels with buttons that you can tap to preview the sound

Please review the index.html so that you fully understand how the current version of the app works.
Then please update the README.md file to reflect the current state of the app

## Notes

_Add your implementation notes, decisions, and documentation here._
