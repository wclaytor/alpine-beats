## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Data Structure

```javascript
// Sound Library Structure
const soundLibrary = {
  categories: {
    kicks: [
      {
        id: 'kick_classic_1',
        name: 'Classic Kick',
        category: 'kicks',
        tags: ['acoustic', 'punchy'],
        sound: Function // Web Audio synthesis function
      }
    ],
    // ... other categories
  }
};

// Drum Kit Structure
const drumKits = {
  classic: {
    id: 'classic',
    name: 'Classic',
    description: 'Acoustic drum kit',
    tracks: [
      { name: 'Kick', soundId: 'kick_classic_1' },
      // ... 7 more tracks
    ]
  }
};

// Track State Structure
const track = {
  name: 'Kick',
  soundId: 'kick_classic_1',
  sound: Function, // Current sound function
  steps: Array(16), // Pattern data
  customized: false, // Has user customized from kit default
  volume: 1.0, // Future: per-track volume
  muted: false // Future: mute functionality
};
```

### 4.2 Storage Requirements

**LocalStorage Schema:**
```javascript
{
  'alpineBeats.currentKit': 'classic',
  'alpineBeats.customSounds': {
    '0': 'kick_808', // Track index: sound ID
    '2': 'hihat_jazz_1'
  },
  'alpineBeats.savedKits': [ // Future: User-created kits
    {
      name: 'My Custom Kit',
      tracks: [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.3 Performance Considerations
- Sound synthesis functions should be optimized and cached
- Lazy load sound categories to reduce initial load
- Debounce rapid sound preview changes (100ms)
- Maximum 8 concurrent audio contexts for tracks
- Use Web Audio API scheduling for precise timing

### 4.4 Browser Compatibility
- Web Audio API support required
- Tested on Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Mobile Safari requires user interaction for audio context
- Provide fallback for browsers without Web Audio API
