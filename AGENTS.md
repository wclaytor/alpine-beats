# AI Agents Instructions - Alpine Beats Drum Machine

## üéØ Overview for AI Agents

This document provides guidance for AI agents working on Alpine Beats, a web-based drum machine built with Alpine.js and Web Audio API. The project uses a **role-based development methodology** where agents adopt specific roles based on the task at hand.

### Project Summary
- **Domain**: Music Production / Audio Application
- **Tech Stack**: Alpine.js 3.x, Web Audio API, Progressive Web App
- **Architecture**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build process)
- **Key Features**: 16-step sequencer, 8 synthesized drum tracks, real-time audio, PWA offline support

### Core Principles
1. **No build process** - Must remain a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
2. **No audio files** - All sounds generated via Web Audio API synthesis
3. **Offline capable** - Must work via Service Worker
4. **Performance critical** - Audio timing must be precise (no latency/jitter)
5. **Mobile friendly** - Touch interactions must be responsive

## üèóÔ∏è Role-Based Development Methodology

## üîÑ Role Collaboration Guidelines

### When Working on Tasks

1. **Identify relevant roles** - Determine which role(s) apply to the task
2. **Adopt role perspective(s)** - Think and respond from that role's expertise
3. **Consider cross-role impacts** - Audio changes affect UI, performance, etc.
4. **Maintain role focus** - Each role has specific concerns and expertise

### Multi-Role Response Pattern

For complex features, respond as multiple roles:

```markdown
**üéØ Product-Owner Analysis**: 
[Why this feature matters to musicians, user value, success criteria]

**üèóÔ∏è Architect Blueprint**: 
[Technical approach, Web Audio API strategy, performance considerations]

**üé® Designer Specifications**: 
[UI/UX design, visual feedback, mobile considerations]

**üíª Developer Implementation**: 
[Complete Alpine.js and Web Audio API code with best practices]

**üß™ QA-Engineer Validation**: 
[Testing checklist, timing validation, browser compatibility checks]
```

### Role Detection Keywords

Use these keywords to identify which role(s) are needed:

- **Product-Owner**: "feature", "workflow", "musician needs", "user story", "beat creation", "why", "value"
- **Architect**: "audio architecture", "timing", "performance", "Web Audio API", "sequencer design", "optimize"
- **Designer**: "UI", "grid", "visual feedback", "mobile", "touch", "accessibility", "layout"
- **Developer**: "implement", "Alpine.js", "code", "synthesis", "sequencer logic", "how to"
- **QA-Engineer**: "test", "audio quality", "timing accuracy", "mobile testing", "browser compatibility", "validate"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Technical Rules

### ALWAYS Follow

1. **Audio Timing Precision**: Use `audioContext.currentTime` for scheduling, NEVER `Date.now()` or `performance.now()`
2. **Exponential Ramps**: Use `exponentialRampToValueAtTime()` for natural-sounding envelopes (never linear for audio)
3. **Stop Oscillators**: Always call `osc.stop()` to prevent memory leaks
4. **No Audio Files**: All sounds must be synthesized via Web Audio API
5. **Touch Events**: Support both mouse and touch events for mobile compatibility
6. **Tempo Changes**: Tempo adjustments take effect on next step to avoid glitches

### Performance Guidelines

- Minimize DOM updates during sequencer playback
- Use `:class` bindings for visual feedback (not direct DOM manipulation)
- Reuse audio nodes where possible to reduce GC pressure
- Use `setTimeout` over `setInterval` for precise timing control
- Test on mobile devices for touch latency

### PWA Best Practices

- Service Worker must cache all essential assets
- App must work completely offline after first load
- Manifest must include proper icons and theme colors
- Support installation on home screen

### Alpine.js State Management Pattern
```javascript
function drumMachine() {
    return {
        tracks: [
            { name: 'Kick', steps: Array(16).fill(false), sound: null },
            // ... 8 tracks total
        ],
        tempo: 120,
        isPlaying: false,
        currentStep: -1,
        intervalId: null,
        audioContext: null,
        
        init() {
            this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
            this.generateDrumSounds();
            this.loadDemoPattern();
        }
    }
}
```

### Web Audio API Patterns

**Audio Context Initialization**:
```javascript
// ALWAYS check for vendor prefixes
this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
```

**Sound Synthesis Pattern**:
```javascript
playKick() {
    const now = this.audioContext.currentTime;
    const osc = this.audioContext.createOscillator();
    const gain = this.audioContext.createGain();
    
    // Frequency envelope for punch
    osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(150, now);
    osc.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.01, now + 0.5);
    
    // Amplitude envelope
    gain.gain.setValueAtTime(1, now);
    gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.01, now + 0.5);
    
    osc.connect(gain);
    gain.connect(this.audioContext.destination);
    
    osc.start(now);
    osc.stop(now + 0.5);
}
```

## üí° Common Development Patterns

### Adding New Drum Sound

**Roles Involved**: Architect (lead), Developer, QA-Engineer

1. **Architect**: Design Web Audio API synthesis approach (oscillators, filters, envelopes)
2. **Developer**: Implement sound synthesis function and integrate into tracks array
3. **QA-Engineer**: Validate sound quality, mixing balance, browser compatibility

**Code Pattern**:
```javascript
// In generateDrumSounds()
this.tracks[X].sound = () => this.playNewSound();

// New sound function
playNewSound() {
    const now = this.audioContext.currentTime;
    // ... synthesis code using oscillators, filters, gain nodes
    // Always call osc.stop() to prevent memory leaks
}
```

### Sequencer Enhancement

**Roles Involved**: Product-Owner (lead), Architect, Designer, Developer, QA-Engineer

1. **Product-Owner**: Define sequencer feature value (swing, sub-steps, pattern length)
2. **Architect**: Design timing calculation changes, state management impact
3. **Designer**: Design UI controls and visual representation
4. **Developer**: Implement timing logic and Alpine.js state updates
5. **QA-Engineer**: Validate timing precision, edge cases, mobile performance

**Timing Pattern**:
```javascript
step() {
    // Calculate step duration based on tempo
    const stepDuration = (60 / this.tempo) * 1000 / 4;
    
    // Use setTimeout for precise timing
    this.intervalId = setTimeout(() => this.step(), stepDuration);
    
    // Advance step counter
    this.currentStep = (this.currentStep + 1) % 16;
    
    // Play active sounds
    this.playCurrentStep();
}
```

4. **Developer**: Implement audio nodes, connections, parameter controls
5. **QA-Engineer**: Test effect quality, parameter ranges, CPU usage

**Effect Chain Pattern**:
```javascript
// Create effect nodes
const filter = this.audioContext.createBiquadFilter();
filter.type = 'lowpass';
filter.frequency.value = 1000;

// Connect in chain: source -> filter -> gain -> destination
source.connect(filter);
filter.connect(gain);
