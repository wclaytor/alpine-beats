# Claude Instructions - Alpine Beats Drum Machine

## 🎯 Project Context and Purpose

Alpine Beats is a fully functional web-based drum machine inspired by the legendary Alesis SR-16. This project demonstrates professional Alpine.js development for creating an interactive music application with real-time audio synthesis, sequencer programming, and PWA capabilities.

**Project Domain**: Music Production / Audio Application
**Tech Stack**: Alpine.js 3.x, Web Audio API, Progressive Web App, Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This application showcases:
- Real-time audio synthesis using Web Audio API
- Interactive 16-step sequencer with 8 drum tracks
- Reactive state management with Alpine.js
- Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- No build process - pure standalone HTML application

## 🥁 When Working on Alpine Beats

### ✅ Focus Areas:
- Enhancing drum sequencer functionality
- Improving Web Audio API sound synthesis
- Adding new drum sounds or effects
- Enhancing user interface interactions
- Performance optimization for audio playback
- PWA features and offline capabilities
- Mobile/touch interface improvements

### ⚠️ Project Constraints:
- **No build process**: Must remain a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
- **No external audio files**: All sounds generated via Web Audio API synthesis
- **Offline capable**: Must work via Service Worker
- **Performance critical**: Audio timing must be precise (no latency/jitter)
- **Mobile friendly**: Touch interactions must be responsive

### Alpine.js State Management Pattern
```javascript
function drumMachine() {
    return {
        // === DRUM TRACKS STATE ===
        tracks: [
            { name: 'Kick', steps: Array(16).fill(false), sound: null },
            // ... 8 tracks total
        ],
        
        // === SEQUENCER STATE ===
        tempo: 120,
        isPlaying: false,
        currentStep: -1,
        intervalId: null,
        audioContext: null,
        
        // === LIFECYCLE ===
        init() {
            this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
            this.generateDrumSounds();
            this.loadDemoPattern();
        },
        
        // === AUDIO SYNTHESIS ===
        playKick() {
            // Web Audio API synthesis
        },
        
        // === SEQUENCER LOGIC ===
        step() {
            // Precise timing using setTimeout
            const stepDuration = (60 / this.tempo) * 1000 / 4;
            this.intervalId = setTimeout(() => this.step(), stepDuration);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Alpine Beats UI Patterns

### Sequencer Grid Pattern
```html
<div class="sequencer">
    <template x-for="(track, trackIndex) in tracks" :key="trackIndex">
        <div class="track">
            <div class="track-label" x-text="track.name"></div>
            <div class="steps">
                <template x-for="(step, stepIndex) in track.steps" :key="stepIndex">
                    <div 
                        class="step" 
                        :class="{ 
                            'active': step, 
                            'current': currentStep === stepIndex 
                        }"
                        @click="toggleStep(trackIndex, stepIndex)"
                        @mouseenter="previewSound(trackIndex)"
                    ></div>
                </template>
            </div>
        </div>
    </template>
</div>
```

### Audio Preview Pattern
```javascript
// Hover interaction for sound preview
previewSound(trackIndex) {
    if (this.tracks[trackIndex].sound) {
        this.tracks[trackIndex].sound();
    }
}
```

### Tempo Control Pattern
```html
<div class="tempo-control">
    <label>Tempo: <span x-text="tempo"></span> BPM</label>
    <input type="range" min="60" max="200" x-model="tempo" @input="updateTempo()">
</div>
```

## 🔊 Web Audio API Integration

### Critical Audio Patterns

**1. Audio Context Initialization**
```javascript
init() {
    // ALWAYS check for vendor prefixes
    this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
}
```

**2. Sound Synthesis Pattern**
```javascript
playKick() {
    const now = this.audioContext.currentTime;
    const osc = this.audioContext.createOscillator();
    const gain = this.audioContext.createGain();
    
    // Frequency envelope for punch
    osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(150, now);
    osc.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.01, now + 0.5);
    
    // Amplitude envelope
    gain.gain.setValueAtTime(1, now);
    gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.01, now + 0.5);
    
    osc.connect(gain);
    gain.connect(this.audioContext.destination);
    
    osc.start(now);
    osc.stop(now + 0.5);
}
```

**3. Noise-Based Sounds (Snare, Hi-hats)**
```javascript
playSnare() {
    const now = this.audioContext.currentTime;
    
    // Noise generation
    const bufferSize = this.audioContext.sampleRate * 0.2;
    const buffer = this.audioContext.createBuffer(1, bufferSize, this.audioContext.sampleRate);
    const data = buffer.getChannelData(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < bufferSize; i++) {
        data[i] = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
    }
    
    const noise = this.audioContext.createBufferSource();
    noise.buffer = buffer;
    
    // Use filters for shaping
    const bandpass = this.audioContext.createBiquadFilter();
    bandpass.type = 'bandpass';
    bandpass.frequency.value = 1500;
    
    // Connect and play
    noise.connect(bandpass);
    bandpass.connect(gain);
    gain.connect(this.audioContext.destination);
    noise.start(now);
}
```

## ⚠️ Critical Alpine Beats Rules

### ALWAYS Follow:

1. **Audio Timing Precision**: Use `audioContext.currentTime` for scheduling, never `Date.now()` or `performance.now()`
2. **Exponential Ramps**: Use `exponentialRampToValueAtTime()` for natural-sounding envelopes (never linear for audio)
3. **Stop Oscillators**: Always call `osc.stop()` to prevent memory leaks
4. **No Audio Files**: All sounds must be synthesized via Web Audio API
5. **Touch Events**: Support both mouse and touch events for mobile compatibility
6. **Tempo Changes**: Tempo adjustments take effect on next step to avoid glitches

### Performance Guidelines:
- Minimize DOM updates during sequencer playback
- Use `:class` bindings for visual feedback (not direct DOM manipulation)
- Reuse audio nodes where possible to reduce GC pressure
- Use `setTimeout` over `setInterval` for precise timing control
- Test on mobile devices for touch latency

### PWA Best Practices:
- Service Worker must cache all essential assets
- App must work completely offline after first load
- Manifest must include proper icons and theme colors
- Support installation on home screen
