# Testing create-epic.py Script

This document describes the test setup for the `create-epic.py` script that creates GitHub issues from structured markdown files.

## Test Files

### test-epic.md

A minimal test input file containing:
- **1 Epic**: "Test Epic for Script Validation"
- **2 Child Issues**: TEST-001 and TEST-002
- **Demonstrates**: Issue creation, linking, dependencies, and metadata

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Python 3.6+ installed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed
- GitHub CLI authenticated: `gh auth login`
- PyYAML package: `pip install pyyaml`

### 2. Test with Dry Run

First, validate the input file format without creating actual issues:

```bash
cd /path/to/alpine-beats
python3 scripts/create-epic.py test-epic.md --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats --dry-run
```

Expected output shows what would be created:
```
üìö Parsing test-epic.md
üéØ Creating Epic: Epic: Test Epic for Script Validation
  [DRY RUN] Would create epic with title: Epic: Test Epic for Script Validation

üìã Creating 2 tickets...
üìù Creating TEST-001: First Test Child Issue
  [DRY RUN] Would create ticket TEST-001
...
```

### 3. Create Actual Issues

Once the dry run looks good, create real issues:

```bash
python3 scripts/create-epic.py test-epic.md --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Create the epic issue
2. ‚úÖ Create TEST-001 child issue
3. ‚úÖ Create TEST-002 child issue (with dependency on TEST-001)
4. ‚úÖ Link child issues back to the epic
5. ‚úÖ Update epic with checkboxes for child issues

### 4. Verify Issues Were Created

Use the provided verification script:

```bash
./scripts/verify-issues.sh wclaytor/alpine-beats test
```

Or manually verify with `gh` CLI:

```bash
# List all issues
gh issue list --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats --limit 10

# View the epic (replace NUMBER with actual issue number)
gh issue view NUMBER --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats

# List issues with 'test' label
gh issue list --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats --label test --state all
```

## Test File Structure

### Epic Definition

```yaml
---
epic:
  title: "Epic: Test Epic for Script Validation"
  labels: ["epic", "test"]
  milestone: ""
  description: |
    This is a test epic created to validate the create-epic.py script functionality.
---
```

### Child Issue Definition

```yaml
---
ticket:
  id: TEST-001
  title: First Test Child Issue
  type: task
  priority: P1
  points: 2
  sprint: 1
  labels: ["test", "child-issue"]
  assignee: ""
  dependencies: []
---

### TEST-001: First Test Child Issue

**Description:**
Issue description...

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

## What Gets Created

When you run the script on `test-epic.md`, it creates:

### Epic Issue

- **Title**: "Epic: Test Epic for Script Validation"
- **Labels**: epic, test
- **Body**: Contains description and a list of child issues
- **Child Issues Section**: Updated with checkboxes linking to TEST-001 and TEST-002

Example epic body:
```markdown
This is a test epic created to validate the create-epic.py script functionality.

Success Criteria:
- Script successfully parses the markdown file
- Epic issue is created in GitHub
- Child issues are created and linked to the epic

## Child Issues
- [ ] #124 - TEST-001
- [ ] #125 - TEST-002
```

### Child Issue: TEST-001

- **Title**: "TEST-001: First Test Child Issue"
- **Labels**: test, child-issue
- **Body**: Includes:
  - Parent Epic: #123
  - Type: task
  - Priority: P1
  - Story Points: 2
  - Sprint: 1
  - Full description with acceptance criteria
  - Link back to parent epic

### Child Issue: TEST-002

- **Title**: "TEST-002: Second Test Child Issue"
- **Labels**: test, child-issue
- **Body**: Includes:
  - Parent Epic: #123
  - Type: task
  - Priority: P2
  - Story Points: 3
  - Sprint: 1
  - Dependencies: #124 (TEST-001)
  - Full description with acceptance criteria
  - Link back to parent epic

## Verification Checklist

After running the script, verify:

- [ ] Epic issue was created with correct title and labels
- [ ] TEST-001 child issue was created
- [ ] TEST-002 child issue was created
- [ ] TEST-002 shows dependency on TEST-001 (references #124)
- [ ] Epic issue was updated with links to both child issues
- [ ] Both child issues reference the parent epic
- [ ] All issues have the 'test' label
- [ ] Issue metadata (priority, points, sprint) is correct

## Cleaning Up Test Issues

After testing, you may want to close the test issues:

```bash
# Close individual issues
gh issue close NUMBER --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats

# Or close all issues with 'test' label
gh issue list --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats --label test --json number --jq '.[].number' | \
  xargs -I {} gh issue close {} --repo wclaytor/alpine-beats
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails with authentication error

**Solution**: Ensure `gh auth login` has been run and completed successfully

### Issues are not created

**Solution**: 
1. Check your GitHub permissions - you need write access to the repository
2. Verify the repository name is correct: `wclaytor/alpine-beats`
3. Check if there are API rate limits: wait a few minutes and try again

### Dry run works but actual creation fails

**Solution**: 
1. Verify gh CLI authentication: `gh auth status`
2. Check repository permissions: `gh repo view wclaytor/alpine-beats`
3. Review script output for specific error messages

## Advanced Usage

### Using with a different repository

```bash
python3 scripts/create-epic.py test-epic.md --repo username/repo-name
```

### Creating your own test file

1. Copy `test-epic.md` to a new file
2. Update the epic and ticket definitions
3. Run with `--dry-run` first to validate
4. Create actual issues

## Script Improvements

The `create-epic.py` script was improved to:

1. **Skip authentication in dry-run mode**: You can now validate input files without authenticating with GitHub
2. **Better error messages**: Clear feedback about what's happening
3. **Dependency linking**: Automatically converts ticket IDs to issue numbers
4. **Epic updates**: Automatically updates the epic with links to all child issues

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test the script with the provided test file
2. ‚úÖ Verify issues were created correctly
3. Create your own markdown files for real epics and features
4. Use the same format for your project planning
